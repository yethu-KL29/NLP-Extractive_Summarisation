# NLP-Extractive_Summarisation
Extractive summarization is a type of text summarization technique where the goal is to create a summary by selecting and extracting important sentences, phrases, or segments directly from the input text, rather than generating new sentences. In this method, the summary is composed of a subset of sentences from the original document.
