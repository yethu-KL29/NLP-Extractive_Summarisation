# Extractive Summarization

This project implements an **extractive summarization** model that extracts important sentences from a given document to generate a coherent summary. The model evaluates sentences based on factors like term frequency, TF-IDF, and cosine similarity to extract the most relevant portions of the text.

## Overview

The **extractive summarization** technique selects important sentences from the input text and assembles them into a shorter version while preserving the original meaning. It avoids rewriting or paraphrasing and simply extracts sentences from the document. This technique is highly efficient for quickly generating summaries of large documents.

## Technologies

This project uses the following technologies:
- **Python** (version 3.x)
- **Libraries**:
  - `nltk` (Natural Language Toolkit) for text preprocessing
  - `sklearn` for TF-IDF vectorization
  - `numpy` and `pandas` for data handling
  - `matplotlib` for visualization (if applicable)
  - `networkx` (optional, for graph-based methods like TextRank)

## Features

- **Sentence Extraction**: Extracts important sentences using techniques like TF-IDF and cosine similarity.
- **Preprocessing**: Handles text cleaning (removes stopwords, punctuation, etc.) for better accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Displays a word cloud of the most common terms used in the document (optional).
- **Customizable**: You can modify the summarization ratio to adjust the length of the summary.
