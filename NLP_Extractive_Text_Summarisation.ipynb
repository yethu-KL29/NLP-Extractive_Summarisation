Seeking a ninth title at his hometown event, and a 99th overall, Federer will play 93th-ranked Marius Copil on Sunday. Federer dominated the 20th-ranked Medvedev and had his first match-point chance to break serve again at 5-1. He then dropped his serve to love, and let another match point slip in Medvedev's next service game by netting a backhand. He clinched on his fourth chance when Medvedev netted from the baseline. Copil upset expectations of a Federer final against Alexander Zverev in a 6-3, 6-7 (6), 6-4 win over the fifth-ranked German in the earlier semifinal. The Romanian aims for a first title after arriving at Basel without a career win over a top-10 opponent. Copil has two after also beating No. 6 Marin Cilic in the second round. Copil fired 26 aces past Zverev and never dropped serve, clinching after 2 1/2 hours with a forehand volley winner to break Zverev for the second time in the semifinal. He came through two rounds of qualifying last weekend to reach the Basel main draw, including beating Zverev's older brother, Mischa. Federer had an easier time than in his only previous match against Medvedev, a three-setter at Shanghai two weeks ago.\",\n          \"Nadal has not played tennis since he was forced to retire from the US Open semi-finals against Juan Martin Del Porto with a knee injury. The world No 1 has been forced to miss Spain\\u0092s Davis Cup clash with France and the Asian hard court season. But with the ATP World Tour Finals due to begin next month, Nadal is ready to prove his fitness before the season-ending event at the 02 Arena. Nadal flew to Paris on Friday and footage from the Paris Masters official Twitter account shows the Spaniard smiling as he strides onto court for practice. The Paris Masters draw has been made and Nadal will start his campaign on Tuesday or Wednesday against either Fernando Verdasco or Jeremy Chardy. Nadal could then play defending champion Jack Sock in the third round before a potential quarter-final with either Borna Coric or Dominic Thiem. Nadal\\u0092s appearance in Paris is a big boost to the tournament organisers who could see Roger Federer withdraw. Federer is in action at the Swiss Indoors in Basel and if he reaches the final, he could pull out of Paris in a bid to stay fresh for London. But as it stands, Federer is in the draw and is scheduled to face either former world No 3 Milos Raonic or Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the second round. Federer\\u0092s projected route to the Paris final could also lead to matches against Kevin Anderson and Novak Djokovic. Djokovic could play Marco Cecchinato in the second round. British No 1 Kyle Edmund is the 12th seed in Paris and will get underway in round two against either Karen Khachanov or Filip Krajinovic.\",\n          \"Maria Sharapova has basically no friends as tennis players on the WTA Tour. The Russian player has no problems in openly speaking about it and in a recent interview she said: 'I don't really hide any feelings too much. I think everyone knows this is my job here. When I'm on the courts or when I'm on the court playing, I'm a competitor and I want to beat every single person whether they're in the locker room or across the net. So I'm not the one to strike up a conversation about the weather and know that in the next few minutes I have to go and try to win a tennis match. I'm a pretty competitive girl. I say my hellos, but I'm not sending any players flowers as well. Uhm, I'm not really friendly or close to many players. I have not a lot of friends away from the courts.' When she said she is not really close to a lot of players, is that something strategic that she is doing? Is it different on the men's tour than the women's tour? 'No, not at all. I think just because you're in the same sport doesn't mean that you have to be friends with everyone just because you're categorized, you're a tennis player, so you're going to get along with tennis players. I think every person has different interests. I have friends that have completely different jobs and interests, and I've met them in very different parts of my life. I think everyone just thinks because we're tennis players we should be the greatest of friends. But ultimately tennis is just a very small part of what we do.

his rare sporting gifts, such a modest return would be unacceptable.', 'To Reid the 15-marker, just being up and at \\x91em was enough; a few bogeys and one well-made par \\x97 broomstick putter and all \\x97 vindication for his recent decision to renew his membership at nearby Bankstown.', 'Exhausted after spending half his round deep in the bushes searching for my ball, as well as those of two other golfers he\\x92d never met before, our incredibly giving designated driver asked if we didn\\x92t mind going straight home after signing off so he could rest up a little before heading to work.', 'Fourteen years after sharing centre court with Roger Federer in the third round of the Australian Open, Reid was now running the counter and coaching kids - but sadly now never mine- in suburban Sydney at the Matraville tennis and squash centre run by his father Bob and beautiful mother Sandra, herselfa former professional.', 'Quite the fall from grace for a prodigious talent once afforded a 3000-word spread in The New York Times.', 'With sponsors and the world at his feet, Reid was 14 then and being mentored by Nick Bollettieri, who fashioned the likes of Andre Agassi, Maria Sharapova, Monica Seles and Jim Courier into world No.1s.', 'Reid, too, was earmarked for the very top, only for injuries and illness to cruel his career.', 'On the up again after taking salvation in the bottle, Reid was found dead on Tuesday aged just 34.', '\\x93I never got over what happened to me when I was 19,\\x94 he told AAP last week.', 'Just as his senior career got legs, Reid was derailed by a debilitating bout of glandular fever.', 'The life-changing setback hit only weeks after the then-teenage wonder boy announced his arrival as a grand slam threat by throwing up all over Rod Laver Arena during a fighting five-set second-round win over Sargis Sargsian.', 'The epic victory set-up his showdown with Federer, who would go on to win his first Australian Open.', '\\x93I was their golden boy then,\\x94 he said of his relationship with Tennis Australia.', '\\x93Now they won\\x92t even give me tickets (to the Open).\\x94 A Davis Cup pick and on the cusp of the world\\x92s 100 by 18, Reid had few other complaints - just a lingering sense of what might have been.', 'He\\x92d backed up his last-32 showingat Melbourne Park with a string of wins over elites including French Open champion and then world No.9 Gaston Gaudio and Roland Garros runner-up Martin Verkerk in 2004 before illness struck.', '\\x93I was on a nice trajectorythen,\\x94 Reid recalled.\\x93If I hadn\\x92t got sick, I think I could have started pushing towards the second week at the slams and then who knows.\\x94 Duringa comeback attempt some five years later, Reid added Bernard Tomic and 2018 US Open Federer slayer John Millman to his list of career scalps.', '\\x93He had one of the best backhands, I think, going around,\\x94 Millman told AAP.', '\\x93But my fondest memory is probably him coming back in Spain with his father and Todd trying to order a ham, cheese and tomato sandwich in the most Aussie English I ever heard.\\x94 Among his lesser known achievements - but even more significantto me - was an injured Reid\\x92s effort to reach the final of the Manly Seaside, a prestigious Christmas-time event won backin the day by the likes of legends Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Frank Sedgman, John Bromwich, Lew Hoad, Neal Fraser, Fred Stolle, Evonne Goolagong and Australia\\x92s last women\\x92s Australian Open champion, Christine O\\x92Neil.', 'Hampered by a shoulder injury, Reid served under-arm - UNDER-ARM - throughout the entire tournament yet still made the decider.', '\\x93I was always happy to work hard,\\x94 he said.', 'He had hoped the mercurial Nick Kyrgios would do the same.', 'A big fan and believer in the enigmatic Canberran, Reid didn\\x92t want to see Kyrgios\\x92s career slip away like his did.', '\\x93Full effort he wouldn\\x92t fail,\\x94 Reid said of Kyrgios.', '\\x93Full effort Nick could live out his tennis like a (Tomas) Berdych or (Jo- Wilfried) Tsonga, consistently making second week,quarters, semis, finals of slams - and then hopefully more.', '\\x93Time will tell for Nick, but he\\x92s still young.\\x94 Todd Reid was still young, too.', 'Tragically, his time ran out.']\n"
